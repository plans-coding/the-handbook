# Shake the whipping cream

## Utensils

* Cocktail Shaker

## Instruction

Pour the whipping cream into the shaker. Shake until you can no longer hear the cream moving inside. You can optionally add a mixer ball for improved results. This trick works great if you want to reduce the amount of dishes or if you donâ€™t have access to electricity, for example on a picnic or outdoor trip.
